# minesweeper-vue
Simple minesweeper game. Used to learn frontend/vue. 

Try it out at [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/p5roscL3/). Left-click to open tiles, Right-click to flag mines.

Feel free to leave issues to give comments on style, idioms, best practices etc! It's a first attempt so I'm not expecting much.

### Features

1. Fully interactive minesweeper game
2. Timer
3. Reset button
4. Progress tracking (remaining tiles to open)
5. Congratulations message when complete!

### Missing features

1. Keeping previous scores (non-goal)
2. A better UI
3. Converting into a component so dimensions and number of mines can be passed as props
